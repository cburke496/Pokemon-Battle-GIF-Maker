# Pokemon Battle GIF Maker (Computer Graphics Final Project):

Run: 

$ make

$ ./gifmaker [pokemon_name_1] [pokemon_name_2]

   where the pokemon names are from this list:
    	  
    	  -wooper
	  
	  -pichu
	  
	  -chikorita
	  
	  -mewtwo




This exports a GIF (named battle.gif) of the selected Pokemon battling, with a random winner.

Alternatively, use gifmaker2 instead of gifmaker for funky lighting.


Note: It's a good idea to run "rm *.ppm" once the program is done, to remove the ppm files, as they're no longer needed.

Note: mat4.c, mat4.h, and cylinder.3dt were made by Peter Brooks
